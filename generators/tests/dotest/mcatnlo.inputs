# This is a bash script that compiles and runs all of the MC@NLO codes.
# On your system, you need:
#
#    bash shell      AND      gmake
#
# which are rather standard (ask your system manager if they are not
# available).
#
# HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT:
#  Look for "physical parameters" and "other input parameters" in
#  in this file; they control all the inputs for the MC@NLO codes.
#  After having modified them to suit your needs, execute this
#  file from a bash shell. Notice that the only command in this
#  file is 
#     runMCatNLO
#  which is what you need in order to obtain MC@NLO results. Other
#  commands are available: see at the bottom of this file for a 
#  list of them. In this version, they are all commented out; 
#  uncomment them if you need them.
#
# WHAT THE USER MUST DO PRIOR TO RUNNING
#  The files 
#     mcatnlo_hwdriver.f   mcatnlo_hwlhin.f
#  must be edited in order to insert the 'INCLUDE HERWIGXX.INC' command
#  relevant to the version of HERWIG your are going to use. The file(s)
#     mcatnlo_hwanXXX.f
#  contain sample analysis routines, and must be edited for the same reason. 
#  Notice, however, that these analysis routines are provided here to furnish 
#  a ready-to-run package, but they are identical to standard HERWIG analysis
#  routines, and should therefore be replaced with your analysis routines.
#  In this case, you will simply set the variable HWUTI (in this file) equal 
#  to the list of files you need in your routines.
#  Finally, the variable HERWIGVER below must be set equal to the name
#  of your preferred version of HERWIG (matching the one whose common
#  blocks are included in the files above)

# (which happens in production for the Drell Yan process if P is a W, Z,

# the mass range is (if PGAMMAX>0)
#    M0_P - PGAMMAX * WIDTH < M_P < M0_P + PGAMMAX * WIDTH
# with M0_P the pole mass of P, and WIDTH its width. If PGAMMAX<0 then

# Valid shell variables correspond to
#    P = V1, V2, T1, T2, H
# for vector boson, top, and Higgs respectively. In the case of top decay,
# the shell variables with prefix Vj are relevant to the W's emerging from 
# the decay of the top whose shell variables have prefix Tj.
# When there is only one vector boson or one top in the final state,
# the relevant shell variables have prefix V1 or T1. In the case of
# vector boson pair production, the prefixes (V1,V2) correspond to (W+,W-), 
# (Z,Z), (W+,Z), and (W-,Z) for IPROC=-2850, -2860, -2870, and 2880 
# respectively. In the case of ttbar production, (T1,T2) correspond 
# to (t,tbar), and (V1,V2) to (W+,W-) emerging from (t,tbar) decays.
# In the case of tW- production, T1 and V2 correspond to t and W- produced
# in the hard reaction respectively (in version 3.4, off-shell effects are
