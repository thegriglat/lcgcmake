Test for tauola++ is changed. Now all hadrons are taken instead of A1, rho, pi, K.
This does not change tauola++ result within errors because 30% of decays in it
go through A1, but changes pythia8 result, where decays are made without A1.
Since version 150 polarization is taken into account in pythia8 tau decays.
With this change of test pythia8 result becomes closer to tauola++ since
version 150

11.04.2011
reference values for hydjet updated: taken from version 1.7,
platform x86_64-slc5-gcc43-opt. Change happened in the version 1.6
due to the decays of K0 and pi0 that were forbidden before
-------------------------------------------------------------------
26.09.2010
Test "herwig_test1" obsolete and removed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
12.01.2010
Replacing pythia8 reference results by the numbers from version 130:
new tune. Test2 is changed.
-------------------------------------------------------------------
04.11.2009
Replacing sherpa reference results by the results obtained with
sherpa version 1.2.0 with new LHC steering files Run.dat essentially
taken from Examples, with the following changes: 1. amegic; 2. N events = 1000
-------------------------------------------------------------------
03.03.2009
Replacing pythia6 reference results by 411.2(atlas default)
(but test3 361,363,367-370,373-377 changed to ones from pythia6 419)

--------------------------------------------------------------------
17.03.2008
As suggested by Hannes Jung the results of cascade-2.0.1 tests should be
considered as the new reference values. Corresponding changes in
reference data file have been made.
--------------------------------------------------------------------
09.08.2008
Reference values for Alpgen tests are changed to the ones 
from Alpgen-2.1.3b-slc4_ia32_gcc34
--------------------------------------------------------------------
09.12.2008
Reference values for pythia6 test3 361,363,367-370,373-377 changed
to ones from pythia6 419. They are changed since 414 due to changes
in the technicolor sector (new particle etc.). Discussed
with S. Mrenna 02.12.2008
--------------------------------------------------------------------
14.12.2008
Reference values for pythia6 test1 changed, taken from version 2.3.0
with statistics 4000 events. Nlljj increased by a factor about 2
due to new underlying event tunings. Cross section slightly increaded.
Discussed with Richardson 12.12.2008
--------------------------------------------------------------------
30.07.2007
Reference results are obtained with:
pythia6_lhcb: Pythia 6.227  on slc3_ia32_gcc323
Sherpa:       Sherpa 1.0.10 on slc3_ia32_gcc323
Jimmy:        Jimmy  4.2    on slc3_ia32_gcc323
--------------------------------------------------------------------
28.06.2007
pythia6_lhcb reference results were obtained with Pythia 6.227
