pythia 1       Cross section of Z + jet with lower Qt cut 20 GeV
pythia 2       Fraction of events from  Z + jet (Z -> all leptons) with 
               2 detectable electrons or muons and 2 jets.
pythia 3       Same as pythia 1,2 (using HepMC/PythiaWrapper.h and event
pythia 4       analyzers from libtests*, see include/ANNHEPMC/)
pythia 5-26    Cross section of single W+- production is calculated using
               various proton PDF sets via LHAPDF library. Tests were up to
               27 (up to 70350), but 70350 stopped to work in lhapdf 5.2.1

herwig 2       Fraction of events from  Z + jet (Z -> all leptons) with
               2 detectable electrons or muons and 2 jets.
herwig 3       Same as 1,2 above but with  Z->e,mu
herwig 4       and using HepMC. (see ./herwig_hepmc.cc)
herwig 5-26    Cross section of single W+- production is calculated using
               various proton PDF sets via LHAPDF library.

Herwig++ 1     Cross section of the default process as run with LHC.in
               In the version 2_0_0 the default process is qq2gZ2ff (note
               that it was different in earlier versions)

isajet 1-24    cross section of single W production (Drell-Yan) at LHC for
               different PDF sets of lhapdf (same as pythia-lhapdf)

lhapdf 1-20    PDF sets values with self-explanatory comments
lhapdf 21-40   PDF sets values obtained using lhaglue with self-explanatory

tauola 1       E(PI+- + K+- + A1+-) / E(TAU) ratio
               in f + fbar  -> Z0 + W+/- with Z0 -> tau+ tau- and
               W+/- -> tau+/- nutau with TAU decayed BY PYTHIA (no tauola)
tauola 2       E(PI+- + K+- + A1+-) / E(TAU) as above TAU decayed by TAUOLA
             
pythia8 1      Do the same as pythia tests 1 and 2. Note that for new
pythia8 2      versions one could need to change the code of the test
               since now part of parameters are set in Fortran part of pythia.
