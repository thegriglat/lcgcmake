 This package has a CMake build system. For backward compatibility, on top
of it there is a configure script. This script can take some arguments,
in the end it initialises the CMake system for You. To see possible arguments 
type "configure --help".

 At the beginning in this directory there is a file Makefile. It is not checked.
When CMake build system is initialised (directly or through the configure script),
Makefile is overwritten.
