Year: 2014
Summary: ZJETS analysis for the GENSER rivet tests
Experiment: None
Collider: None
Status: VALIDATED
Authors:

RunInfo:
  $l^+ l^-$ + jets analysis with $l = e, \mu$. Usually used default
  generator $M_{ee}$ mass cuts and lower $p_T$ cut 20 GeV
NumEvents: 1000000
NeedCrossSection: yes
PtCuts: [25]
Description:
  'The analysis looks for Z decaying to ee or mumu. If it is found, jets are
   reconstructed. The following Z and jets variables are histogrammed: Z $p_T$,
   jet multiplicity (simple and normalized histogram), jet1 $p_T$, jet2 $p_T$.
   The histogram binning is optimized for the limited statistics available in
   the GENSER tests'
