LHAPDF versions >= 5.8.3 

GENSER's build system is used to build all the authors tests examples:
Example[1-9].f and CCTest[1-5].cc

You can copy this directory to any location, go to there and then type:
./configure OPTIONS && make
to prepare all executables. 

Type ./configure --help  for explanation of the options.

To run some example do:
( . path.sh ; ./lhapdf-<example_name> )

Some of these examples create grid files (several megabytes) during 
the first run. This takes several minutes.
